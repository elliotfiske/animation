Lab 6 - Bilinear Interpolation
==============================

Today we're going to use bilinear interpolation to deform a 2D mesh.

Please download the code for the lab and go over the code.

When you compile and run the source code, you should see a 2D figure with a
cage around it. The cage is draggable, but it won't do anything until you
implement a couple of functions. You can change the grid size by modifying
`grid->setSize()` in the `loadScene()` function in `main.cpp`.

Task 1
------

Set the grid size back to `(2, 2)` to get a 2 by 2 array of grid points. Take
a look at the function `ShapeCage::load()`. The `posBuf` vector is being
filled with the data from the obj file. In the `ShapeCage::toLocal()`
function, which is called once at the beginning of the program, this data is
being passed through without modification to the `posLocalBuf` vector, and in
the `ShapeCage::toWorld()` function, which is called every frame, this data is
being passed back to the `posBuf` vector. (Note that `posBuf` is of size
`3*nVerts`, since it comes from the input obj file, whereas `posLocalBuf` is
of size `2*nVerts`, since only the 2D local coordinates are stored.) This
obvious does nothing when the grid moves. What you want to do instead is to
properly compute the local coordinates and then compute the world coordinates
from the local coordinates PLUS the new grid configuration.

First, implement the `ShapeCage::toLocal()` function. For now, since there is
only one tile in the grid, you can ignore the `tileIndexBuf` vector. (We will
be using this later when we increase the grid size.) For each vertex,
`posLocalBuf` should store where that vertex is with respect to the grid
tile â€” i.e., its local coordinates. To get the four control points for the tile,
use the following:

	vector<Vector2f> cps = grid->getTileCPs(0);

The returned vector `cps` contains the four control points in this order:

To compute the local coordinates `(u, v)` of a vertex, get the minimum and
maximum `(x, y)` world coordinates of the tile, and then use the following
formula:

$$
u = \frac{x - x_\min}{x_\max - x_\min}, \qquad v = \frac{y - y_\min}{y_\max - y_\min}.
$$

Once the local coordinates are computed properly, you should see the character
in the top right corner as shown. This is because the world goes from `(-1,
-1)` to `(1, 1)`, and the local coordinates are between 0 and 1. Once we
implement `toWorld()` in the next task, the character will fill the whole tile
again.

Task 2
------

Now implement `ShapeCage::toWorld()`. In this function, you should do the
reverse of the transformation you applied above so that the `posBuf` vector is
filled with proper values. In other words, for each vertex, apply the bilinear
interpolation function:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& P_0(u) = (1 - u) P_{00} + u P_{01},\\
& P_1(u) = (1 - u) P_{10} + u P_{11},\\
& P(u,v) = (1 - v) P_0(u) + v P_1(u).
\end{aligned}
$$

You can get the four control points, $P_{00}$ through $P_{11}$ with the call
to `grid->getTileCPs(0)` as before. You should now be able to move the
character by moving the control points.

Task 3
------

Increase the grid size to `(5, 5)`. Since there are multiple tiles now, the
current code does not work. You need to change both `ShapeCage::toLocal()` and
`ShapeCage::toWorld()`.

In `ShapeCage::toLocal()`, you need to find which tile each vertex belongs to
by looping through all of the tiles. You can do this with a double for-loop
using the `nrows` and `ncols` variables and a call to `grid->indexAt(row,
col)`.

	// Find which tile this vertex belongs to
	for(int col = 0; col < ncols-1; ++col) {
		for(int row = 0; row < nrows-1; ++row) {
			// Get the four control points for corresponding to (row, col)
			int tileIndex = grid->indexAt(row, col);
			vector<Vector2f> cps = grid->getTileCPs(tileIndex);
			//
			// DO SOME STUFF HERE
			//
		}
	}

Keep in mind that `nrows` and `ncols` are the number of control points in the
x and y directions, and so the number of tiles is `nrows-1` by `ncols-1`. The
tile index takes on the value of the control point at its lower left corner.
For example, if `nrows=3` and `ncols=3`, then the tile indices are:

In addition to the local coordinates, each vertex needs to store the tile
index. Store this in the `tileIndexBuf` vector. Note that the length of this
vector is `nVerts`, whereas the length of `posLocalBuf` is `2*nVerts`.

In `ShapeCage::toWorld()`, you should use both `tileIndexBuf` and
`posLocalBuf` to compute `posBuf`. First find the four control points you need
from the tile index of the vertex. Then use bilinear interpolation to find the
world coordinates of the vertex. You should now be able to move the numerous
control points to pose the character.

Task 4
------

Now we're going to implement bilinear interpolation on the GPU. You should add
a keyboard hook to switch between the CPU and the GPU versions, or you can
start a brand new project in a different folder.

The `ShapeCage::toLocal()` function is going to remain the same. However, you
will no longer be needing the `ShapeCage::toWorld()` function, since you will
be doing this transformation in the vertex shader. Think about what you need
to do to replace this function with GPU code.

Miscellaneous tips:

- Before, you were passing `posBuf` to the vertex shader as an attribute
  variable. Now you'll be passing in `posLocalBuf` instead. You need to
  transform these positions from local to world in the vertex shader.
  *Important*: `posBuf` is loaded from the obj file, and so it contains
  (x,y,z) values for each position, but `posBufLocal` should only contain (u,v)
  values. Therefore, the 2nd argument of `glVertexAttribPointer()` should be
  2, not 3.
- In addition, you need to pass `tileIndexBuf` as an attribute variable.
  You'll need to use a float rather than an int because some graphics cards do
  not support integer data types. In GLSL, you can cast a float to int using a
  C++ style cast.

		float bar;
		...
		int foo = int(bar);

- You can hard code the grid size in the shader to `(5, 5)`.
- You can pass in the 25 control points as a uniform parameter (`prog` will
  have to be changed to match whatever variable name you're using).

		// In the vertex shader:
		uniform vec2 cps[25];
		...
		// In main.cpp:
		glUniform2fv(prog->getUniform("cps"), 25, grid->getAllCPs()[0].data());

- To access the four control points of the kth tile in the vertex shader:

		vec2 cp00 = cps[k];
		vec2 cp01 = cps[k + 1];
		vec2 cp10 = cps[k + ncols];
		vec2 cp11 = cps[k + ncols + 1];

- You'll need to add a new argument to `ShapeCage::draw()` for the tile index
  attribute array.
